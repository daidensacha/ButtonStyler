## USER STORY IMAGES

[Return to README](README.md/#user-story-review)

1. As an aspiring developer:
	- I want to play with styles to see what works and what doesn't work.

	- I want to see how the different style attributes work.
	- I want to see how to write CSS for buttons.
	- I want to create button styles on the fly to save time.
	- I want to learn how to design buttons.

The layout of the elements benefits the user by allowing them to see what is changing and what happens as they change the styling. 
The change is instantaneous. The JavaScript function processes changes in values from the inputs and CSS rules are updated, appended to the head style tags and the CSS display block. Playing with the form inputs, you can watch as you slowly slide a range selector, for instance. Watch the value change in the range selector tooltip that shows the range value. That same value instantly changes in the CSS display block, and you can observe how the style of the button is changing. As a learning tool, it is brilliant and accelerates the learning of CSS. I believe that this meets the need of the aspiring developer in the user stories. There I identified that the aspiring developer wants to see what works and what doesn't work. They also what to know how the different attributes 
work, and learn how to write CSS for buttons. 
In the short time I played with this tool, my understanding of balancing the different attributes to create a styled button has improved.

The above image shows the CSS output displayed simultaneously in the head style tags and the CSS output display block.
Being able to witness that change as it happens and see it visually in the style of the button is helpful.  

![CSS Gradient Output](/assets/documentation/images/screenshots/css-output-2.jpg)  

The above example shows how the gradient CSS rule output.
In the CSS block, the CSS output is in `<code><pre></pre></code>` tags so that it will overflow when needed and will not fold. It's a quirk of using the `pre` tags.   It's easy to copy with the copy to clipboard icon. Note the button is showing the gradient background.


2. As a hobbyist who likes to dabble with HTML and CSS:
	- I want to enjoy playing and be able to create buttons easily.
	- I want to see the result as I create it to know what I will have.

The project meets the needs identified in the "hobbyist" user stories. 
The included form elements provide a variety of options for the user to play and experiment.

I made it as simple as possible for the inexperienced user to copy the CSS after creating a button style. They can 
then click the link to codepen in the "2. Copy the CSS" section under the CSS display, and paste the button CSS to see it work.

**Information Section targets the inexperienced user**

3. As a developer:
	- I'm always looking and open to trying tools to make my work more efficient and save me time.
	- I want to be able to enter colors that I am working with to easily create buttons that fit within the colors of my project.
	- I want to be able to play with designs and effects, and colors to discover what is possible.

The following image illustrates how I tested the color pickers. I entered HEX, HEXA, RGB, RGBA color format into the color picker input and the corresponding color 
was displayed in the color picker.

Additionally, I the pallete of colors I added in the color pickers, as follows.


**Bootstrap palette:**

`palette:'#007bff #6610f2 #6f42c1 #e83e8c #dc3545 #fd7e14 #f0ad4e #28a745 #20c997 #17a2b8 #fff #f8f9fa #6c757d #343a40 #000 rgba(0,0,0,0)',`

| Bootstrap Name    | bootstrap color   |Class Name         |
|:------------------|:------------------|:------------------|
|--blue:            |#007bff;           |.primary           |

|--teal:            |#20c997            |                   |      
|--cyan:            |#17a2b8            |.info              |

|--black            |#000               |                   |  
|                   |rgba(0,0,0,0)      |.opacity-0         | 

This is a convenient feature for users who might be using the Boostrap framework, given the ablity to easily select Bootstrap 
default colors if they are needed.

**A variety of options conveniently folded up inside the accordion**  

A text box, three selects, eleven color pickers, thirteen range selectors, and six toggle switches are all bundled up neatly inside the accordion to offer various options for all anticipated users. Here are some images showing the different forms, with their inputs that change the style of the button and the CSS display values.

- **The Owner**


1. As the owner:
	- I want to have a tool that makes my job easier.
	- I want to create a tool that I have used online before, but that does things I want it to do.
	- I want to create it to my design preferences and to be able to change it when I want to.
	- I want to be able to add to it and to expand it to improve it.
	- I want to share this tool with others who might also benefit from it.
	- I want to do this project to learn and to be able to put to use the things I have been learning in this last unit.

Developing this tool has given me invaluable experience. I've had this opportunity to apply what I have been learning to 
build something that does a job I want it to do. 

As my first JavaScript project, in hindsight, I would do some things differently, but I can say that I did the best possible 
with the information and experience, I had at this time. 

The time I spent working my way through problems and finding solutions has given me an excellent ground to look at such a project again
with a different perspective. What I created can be easily replicated. I can add new features very quickly, as I know the code of this site backward. 

Adding inputs, color pickers, or range selectors is as easy as copy and paste, and writing a little bit of JS to define variables and CSS strings. 

It has arisen out of a need and the desire to fulfill that need. I'm curious how it might evolve with input from other sources.
