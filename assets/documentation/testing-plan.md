## TESTING PLAN
[README/Testing](/README.md/#testing)
### RESEARCH
[README/Research](/README.md/#research)

#### Required elements
    
   -  Investigate what components will be suitable and meet the needs of this project.
   -  Research how the components work and how to write code to implement them.
   -  It is crucial to understand how the components function and what I can expect from them.
   -  Use Codepen to experiment, learn, and implement instances of the components to see which are better suited for the button styler project.

### DEVELOPMENT
[README/Development](/README.md/#development)

  #### HTML
    
   - Incorporate form components using HTML5 and Bootstrap with SCSS/ CSS.
    - Form components to incorporate 
		- Accordion
		- Forms with Fieldsets
		- Inputs with labels
		- Nav-bar/ Off-canvas
		- Modal with contact form
		- Social icon block 
    - Incorporate Bootstrap Breakpoints as media queries in CSS for responsive display.
    - Use Chrome DevTools to ensure positioning of elements for each breakpoint.
    
 #### JavaScript
    
   -   Write code to process data from form inputs and to create CSS styling for the demo button.
   -   What is expected from the different components?
		- **Text input**: When a user enters text, the text will show in the demo button.
		- **Range selector**: When the user changes the value, it will change the corresponding CSS rule style.
		- **Color Picker** - When a user selects or enters a color, it will change the corresponding  CSS rule/ style.
		- **Toggle switches**: When clicked, it will toggle fieldsets on/ off or toggle between options.
		- **Forms with Fieldsets**: The contact form will have required fields for browser validation, and the user will be able to send a message using the contact form.  
		- **Demo button**: The Demo Button will display the CSS style, which will change when the user changes the input values.  
		- **CSS Display block**: The CSS rules for the styles displayed in the Demo Button will be output to the CSS Display Block  
		- **Copy to clipboard**: User can click an icon and copy the CSS to the clipboard.
- Use Chrome DevTools JS console to monitor for errors and test code with "console.logs".

### DEPLOYMENT
[README/Deployment](/README.md/#deployment)

#### Test for production

- **Test local and test live**
	- Until this point, the website has been tested on the local server.
	- Compare and test deployed version of the website.
		- Ensure it is the same and there are no bugs.
		- Inputs, forms, features need to display and function as expected.

 -  **Responsiveness**
    - Chrome DevTools: 
	    - Test by screen sizes
	    - Test by viewing media queries which will specifically include Bootstrap breakpoints.
	    - Test on different devices, different operating systems, different browsers, screen sizes.
    - Share the application to get third party feedback
-  **Function**
	- Test on different devices, operating systems, and browsers.
	- Test all external links, inputs, forms, navigation links, and features.
-  **User Experience** 
    - **Feedback**: Share the application to get feedback and to test the UI to see how users intuit the process of using the application.
    - **User Stories**: Check the application fulfills the needs expressed in the user stories.
    
### DEVELOPMENT SETUP
#### Code Editor
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 
- [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

I edit my work locally using Visual Studio Code with Live Server and Chrome DevTools.
I have a USB-C to dual HDMI hub for my MacBook Pro, with 2 x Dell U2419H monitors, wireless keyboard, and mouse.
